# Building Engineering / Notebooks

This repository will be used to supply students with some example Jupyter(lab) Notebook calculations to get them started with programming in Python using Jupyter(lab).

The example notebooks are stored in the folder "example-notebooks". Currently available examples:
* **HIVOSS_floor_vibration.ipynb** - Example for calculating the natural frequency of a simply supported beam

# Building Engineering / Notebooks

This repository will be used to supply students with some example Jupyter(lab) Notebook calculations to get them started with programming in Python using Jupyter(lab), and to share student work with each other.


## Example notebooks (by @marcoschuurman)

The example notebooks are stored in the folder "example-notebooks". Currently available examples:
* **HIVOSS_floor_vibration.ipynb** - Example for calculating the natural frequency of a simply supported beam
* **ALG_beam_std** - Calculations of simply supported beams (uses ALG_funcs)
* **ALG_funcs** - Some functions for use in other sheets
* **ALG_trillingssignalen** - General processing of vibration signals, e.g. for use in earthquake engineering, vibration nuisance, etc.

## Student work

Student work is stored in the folder "students". Currently available:
* **4pile pile cap optimization (2020 @frisovansprengler)

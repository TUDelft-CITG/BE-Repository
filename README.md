# Building Engineering / Notebooks

This repository will be used to supply students with some example Jupyter(lab) Notebook calculations to get them started with programming in Python using Jupyter(lab), and to share student work with each other.


## Example notebooks (by [Marco Schuurman](https://github.com/marcoschuurman))

The example notebooks are stored in the folder "example-notebooks". Currently available examples:
* **HIVOSS_floor_vibration.ipynb** - Example for calculating the natural frequency of a simply supported beam
* **ALG_beam_std** - Calculations of simply supported beams (uses ALG_funcs)
* **ALG_funcs** - Some functions for use in other sheets
* **ALG_trillingssignalen** - General processing of vibration signals, e.g. for use in earthquake engineering, vibration nuisance, etc.

## Student work

Student work is stored in the folder "students". Currently available:
* Bachelor End Projects
  * **4pile pile cap optimization** - Eurocode calculation for concrete 4p pile caps, with optimization routines for cost and sustainability (2020 [Friso van Spengler](https://github.com/Frisovanspengler))
  *  **Design tool for vibration nuisance** - 1-spring-mass-system design tool to calculate the response of a mass to a harmonic base excitation, and compare vibration speeds to nuisance target values according to Dutch SBR Guideline B (2021 Jippe van Daalen)

## External (Github) links
* Master theses:
  * **[StructuralComponents 8 (Force flow design tool)](https://github.com/FlorisWL/Graduation-BE)** - A Grasshopper-based force flow design tool for conceptual structural design, applying the principles of 2D Graphic Statics to solve forces graphically, and display the force distribution intuitively (2021 [Floris Bruinsma](https://github.com/FlorisWL))
